#How to build with docker
1) Clone repo
2) In the project folder: docker build -t assignment2 .
3) docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 assignment2
4) access http://localhost:3000 through browser to see the visualization

P.S. reallyyyyyyy sorry for late commit but I just found out that the docker doesn't work because of wrong port numbers
